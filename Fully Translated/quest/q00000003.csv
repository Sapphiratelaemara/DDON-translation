Respect them and try to solve the problem.
I'll leave it to you to make the difference."

礎を解放しリム転移が使えるようになれば
神殿とテルの往来も楽になるだろう","By the way, before you go to the abandoned house,

very few people approach the abandoned house."
"今は魔物の巣窟となっていても不思議ではないと
わたしは思っている","It is not strange that it has now become 
a den of monsters, I think."
"《廃屋の地下室》はどっちかって？
それなら村の西、そこにある《エテルナ装具屋》
の裏をまっすぐさ","""Which way to the Abandoned House Cellar?""
If that's the case, 
go straight behind Eterna's Outfitter,
located in the west of the village."
"しかし、あんな場所に何の用だい？","But what do you want in a place like that?"
"ほう――
魔物は貴君が退治したのか
さすが、レオが見込んだ覚者だ","Oh—

- a young woman from the village."

つまり、その女が金を全部受け取った","The one who defeated the enemy was 
officially the Knight Order.
In other words, the woman received all the money."
"おれの想像だがガルドリンは女から
金をむしり取ったに違いない
となれば、まったく、悪党だよ、あいつは","My guess is that Gurdolin has been extorting 
money from women.
 If that's the case, he's a real scoundrel."
"もっとも、この話は騎士団にとっても
恥ずべきことだから誰にも言えない
せめて、おまえに話すことで
うさを晴らさせてもらうぞ","However, this story is a disgrace
even for the Knights, so I can't tell anyone.
But at least I will confide in you
to relieve my burden."
"手柄をそんなことに利用されて
腹を立てているんだろう？","Are you upset that your accomplishments are being 
used for such a thing?"
"おかえりなさい","Welcome back."
"ガルドリンと一緒だったらしいね
ぼくはあの人が苦手でね――わかるだろ？","I heard you were with Gurdolin.
I'm not very good with him - you know what I mean?"
"ある日突然出現した巨大建造物――","One day, a gigantic structure suddenly appeared -"
"まだ正体は不明だが、あれを大石塊（アーク）と
呼ぶことにした、おまえも、覚えておくといい","Although its true nature is still unknown, 
we have decided to call it the ""The Ark"". 
It would be wise for you to remember that as well."
"ガルドリン、どうだった？","How was Gurdolin?"
"ちょーっと押しが強いけれど
戦場じゃその方が頼りになるんだよね
仲良くしとくといいよ","They might be a bit pushy,
but on the battlefield, they're reliable.
It's better to get along with them."

メイリーフがたいくつすると
事件が起こるんです――","I have a bad premonition...

ご苦労だったな","Oh, you're back.
Thanks for your help."
"テル村での事の次第は
ガルドリンから報告を受けたところだ","I just got a report from
Gurdolin on what happened in Tel Village."
"魔物を倒したのに騎士団の顔を立てようと
手柄を譲った――","Even though you defeated the monster, 
you let the knights take credit to save face."
"まあ、わからないでもない
命令とは全然違うことをしたわけだからな","Well, I can see why you feel that way. 
After all, you did something completely different 
from what you were ordered to do."
"いや、もう何も言うな
この件は忘れよう
悪いことをしたわけじゃない","No, please don't say anything anymore. 
Let's forget about this matter. 
You didn't do anything wrong."
"さて――おまえの留守中、考えていたのだが
覚者としてもうひと皮むけるために
ポーンとの契約に挑んでみないか？","Now, while you were away, I was thinking
that in order to further evolve as an Arisen,
why don't you try entering into a 
contract with a Pawn?"
"彼らは主人となる覚者に絶対の忠誠を誓う
怖れ知らずの戦人（いくさびと）だ","They pledge absolute loyalty to the Arisen 
who becomes their master.
They are fearless warriors."
"加えて、彼らの物作りの能力は
鋭い剣、強固な鎧――
おまえに様々な装具をもたらすだろう","In addition, their craftsmanship abilities will
bring you sharp swords, solid armor--
a variety of accoutrements!"
"もちろん、そう簡単に親しくなれるわけじゃない","Of course, it's not easy to become close friends."
"契約の手順など具体的なことは
イリスに聞いてくれ","As for specific details such as the procedure for 
the contract, please ask Iris."
"ああ――
この謁見の間を出た大階段の下の広場で
ファビオやキャメロンが、お前を待っていたぞ","Ah――
In the plaza beneath the grand staircase, 
after leaving the Audience Chamber,
Fabio and Cameron were waiting for you."
"奴らの用事が済んだら
また俺のところに顔を出してくれ","Once your business is done,
please come and visit me again."
